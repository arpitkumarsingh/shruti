                        In India, there are a few more steps:
                        <br>
                        Boy loves Girl. Girl loves Boy.<br>
                        Girl’s family has to love boy. Boy’s family has to love girl.<br>
                        Girl’s Family has to love Boy’s Family. Boy’s family has to love girl’s family.<br>
                        Girl and Boy still love each other. They get married.</p><br>
